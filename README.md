# Professional README Generator

## Description

This week's challenge allows us to utilize our skills to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

The following walkthrough video demonstrates the functionality of the README generator. The video shows how a user would invoke the application from the command line and how they would enter responses to all of the prompts. In the end of the video, a finished README is presented.

The user will need to have Node.js installed. Follow the instructions outlined in the [Node Installation Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

To install inquier, please use `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` in the command line. The application can then be initialized using the `node index.js` command. 

## Usage

A README file is a key component of a developer's profile containing essential information about the repository's project. Once all technologies listed in the Installation section above have been installed, simply invoke the application by using the `node index.js` command.
